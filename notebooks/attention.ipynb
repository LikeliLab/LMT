    "In the self-attention mechanism the sequences of token embedding vectors, ${x_1, \\cdots x_N}$, can be thought of as values and these values will be used to create the context vectors. Furthermore, we will also use sequences of token embedding vectors,  ${x_1, \\cdots x_N}$, directly as the keys for each corresponding value. So using the dictionary example before you could imagine our dictionary looks like $\\{x_1:x_1, x_2:x_2, \\cdots, x_N:x_N\\}$. This example is to simply an analogy to help our understanding we will of course not acutally be using these dictionaries in the attention mechanism. Now consider a single token embedding vector, $x_m$, from our sequence of token embedding vectors, ${x_1, \\cdots x_N}$. The token embedding vector $x_m$ will be our query. For each $x_m$ will then measure the \"degree of match\" (or similarity) between the $x_m$ and all the keys (our sequence of token embedding vectors ${x_1, \\cdots x_N}$). This measure of \"degree of match\" will then be used as the weights in a linear combination of the values to produce the context embedding vector $y_m$. We will repeat this produce treating each embedding vector as a query and using it to find the weights to use in a linear combination of the values to produce the corresponding context embedding vector. Of course using matrix multiple we can calculate all the necessary weights at once.\n",

    "A common method to determine the degree of match (or similarity) between a query vector and a key vector is to take their [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product). Let $a^*_{nm}$ be the unconstrained attention weights. We will refer to these as attention scores as in (Raschka, 2024). Then for a given query $x_n$ and key $x_m$ the attention score is defined to be $a^*_{nm} = x^T_n x_m$. To constrain the values to be non-negative and sum to one we will apply the [softmax function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function). This results in the attention weights:\n",

Applying the softmax function across the rows we get $A = \\text{Softmax}[\\mathbf{XX^T}] = \\text{Softmax}[\\mathbf{A^*}]$ where the softmax function is apply across the rows independently. Finally we can apply this attention weights to the values (another set of the input token embeddings token embedding) using matrix multiplcation.
